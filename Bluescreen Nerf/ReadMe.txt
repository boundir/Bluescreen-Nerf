Commander, we should equip our soldiers with Bluescreen rounds because really, why not?
[/quote]
[h1]Description[/h1]
This mod intention is to make you think twice on who you will equip your Bluescreen rounds on.
It will reduce the damage on mechanical units to 4 instead of 5.
You will have a penalty of 1 damage when using Bluescreen rounds on non-mechanical units.

[h1]Configuration[/h1]
You can edit the damages by going into the mod config file [u]XComGameCore.ini[/u], then modify the lines:
In [u]XComBluescreen.ini[/u] you can edit if you want Bluescreen to be added to Experimental Ammo project (Proving Ground).
Finally, you can edit the cost for purchasing the ammo in [u]XComStrategyTuning.ini[/u].
